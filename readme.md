Factor Calculator
=================

The Factor Calculator is a web-based tool that allows users to find all the factors of a given positive integer. Factors are the numbers that divide a given integer evenly without a remainder. For example, the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

The Factor Calculator has a simple and user-friendly interface where users can enter a positive integer and click on the "Calculate Factors" button. The tool then displays a table that lists all the factors of the entered integer, along with their corresponding products that result in the original integer. The table also shows the total number of factors found.

The Factor Calculator can handle integers up to 100,000. For larger integers, the tool uses a web worker to calculate the factors asynchronously, so that the user interface remains responsive during the calculation.

The Factor Calculator can be useful for a variety of mathematical applications, such as finding the common factors of two integers, checking whether an integer is a prime number, or factoring a polynomial.
